        <h1>My Advocacy</h1>
        <p>I am an advocate of digital literacy, a very important skill that an individual needs to have in order to survive and exist in a fully advanced highly technological world. People need to acquire the knowledge and be able to access and comprehend and use digital tools, thus bridging the gap between individuals who are fully benefiting from technology and those that are left behind. 

I advocate for empowerment of education and access initiatives and awareness campaigns to bring empowerment to the hands of people, especially those under-served to confidently interact with the rest of the world in this digitally defined age thereby bringing everyone into a society that is digitally inclusive where each one is enabled to adapt, succeed and innovate as well.</p>
